# barrage-server
The backend of barrage.

*this project is in the developing, but it is coded in golang, so I mind that 
following proverbs could temporarily instead.*


<article style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Simple, Poetic, Pithy</h2>

<p>Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.</p>

<p>Concurrency is not parallelism.</p>

<p>Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.</p>

<p>The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.</p>

<p>Make the zero value useful.</p>

<p>interface{} says nothing.</p>

<p>Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.</p>

<p>A little copying is better than a little dependency.</p>

<p>Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.</p>

<p>Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.</p>

<p>Cgo is not Go.</p>

<p>With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.</p>

<p>Clear is better than clever.</p>

<p>Reflection is never clear.</p>

<p>Errors are values.</p>

<p>Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.</p>

<p>Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.</p>

<p>Documentation is for users.</p>

<p>Don't panic.</p>
